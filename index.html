          <h3>The Challenge and The Way</h3>
          <p>I am looking for professional fulfillment and compatibility with my routine and family life. I am the father and I want to be and be present in my children's lives, as I have done so far. I want to be able to provide them with everything they deserve (and our children always deserve the best). I believe that this "new" vocation (if I can call it that) can lift me up to all those dreams. I'm not afraid of making mistakes and taking chances. I already have my compass and my flashlight, I just need the way that will open me. Challenge-me!</p>
